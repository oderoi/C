    "\n",
    "Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.\n",
    "- You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.\n",
    "- The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.\n",
    "- You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant. \n",
    "    - For these cities, you have the city population.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note:\n",
    "  - `X` is the population of a city\n",
    "  - `y` is the profit of a restaurant in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.   \n",

    "- $(f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) -y^{(i)})^2$ is the squared difference between the target value and the prediction.   \n",

    "_**3.1 Cost versus iterations of gradient descent**_\n",
    "\n",
    "A plot of cost versus iterations is a useful measure of progress in gradient descent. Cost should always decrease in successful runs. The change in cost is so rapid initially, it is useful to plot the initial decent on a different scale than the final descent. In the plots below, note the scale of cost on the axes and the iteration step.\n",

    "The fact that the cost function squares the loss, $ \\sum_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$  ensures that the 'error surface' is convex like a soup bowl. It will always have a minimum that can be reached by following the gradient in all dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.0 Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, we utilize input training data to fit the parameters $w$,$b$ by minimizing a measure of the error between our predictions $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$ and the actual data $y^{(i)}$. The measure is called the $cost$, $J(w,b)$. In training you measure the cost over all of our training samples $x^{(i)},y^{(i)}$\n",

    "\n",
    "The plot shows $\\frac{\\partial J(w,b)}{\\partial w}$ or the slope of the cost curve relative to $w$ at three points. The derivative is negative. Due to the 'bowl shape', the derivatives will always lead gradient descent toward the bottom where the gradient is zero.\n",

    "- You don't need to implement anything for this part. Simply run the cells below. \n",

    "- A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look\n",
    "at the value of $J(w,b)$ and check that it is decreasing with each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming you have implemented the gradient and computed the cost correctly and you have an appropriate value for the learning rate alpha, $J(w,b)$ should never increase and should converge to a steady value by the end of the algorithm.\n",
