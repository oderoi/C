# Factorial

The factorial of a _**non-negative integer n**_, denoted by _**n!**_, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to _**n**_.

The factorial of _**n**_ with the next smaller factorial: 


$n! = n$ x $(n - 1)$ x $(n - 2)$ x $(n - 3)$ x $\cdots$ x $3$ x $2$ x $1$

$n! = n . (n -1) . (n - 2) \dots  3 . 2 . 1$

$n! = n$ . $(n - 1)!$

$n! = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} i.$

example: $5! = 5 . 4! = 5.4.3! = 120$
