#Matrix Multiplication in C

Given two matrices A of dimensions M x K and B of dimension K x N, we want to compute their dot product C = A . B, 
which is also known as matrix multiplication.

The dot product.

$C += A . B$

$1D Array.$

$C_{i} = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n} (A_{i} . B_{i}) = A_{1}B_{1} + A_{2}B_{2} + ...+ A_{n}B_{n}$

$2D Array.$

$C_{i , j} = \sum\limits_{k \in [0 ... K) } (A_{i , k} . B_{k , j})$

$C_{i , j} = A_{i , k} . B_{k , j}$

Consider

$A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}  ==   A \in \mathbb{R}^{rowA \times colA}$

$B \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}  ==   B \in \mathbb{R}^{rowB \times colB}$

$Code$
